# Sorting Algorithms

A collection of sorting algorithms implemented in various languages. All algorithms currently operate on lists or arrays of numerical values. Ideally tests will be created alongside sorting algorithm implementations. The purpose of this respository is:

1) To give me a place to practice using git, ideally with a more realistic workflow than my usual projects
2) To practice new langauges as I pick them up
3) To refresh my memory on basic sorting alogorithms and explore ones that I didn't encounter in school.

# To Do

- [x] Start implementing sorts in Python
- [ ] Implement merge sort, shell sort, counting sort, and radix sort in Python
- [ ] Start implementing sorts in C
- [ ] Start implementing sorts in swift
